            <p>
                These are my 5 hacks to get more veggies in your diet. The fifth
                one is a game changer, but I'll start with the reason Veghacker
                exists...
            </p>

            <h2>1. Keep a veg log</h2>

            <blockquote>

                Habits
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                When you want to create a healthy habit, it helps to measure the
                right thing. With veg, it's the variety that counts.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've been keeping a daily log of the different types of veg I
                eat since 2nd September 2020 and it's really motivating. I made
                the
                <a href="/">Veghacker app</a> to make this super convenient.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Buy more vegetables</h2>

            <p>
                Might seem obvious, but to eat more veg, you must buy more veg.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next time you are buying groceries, get at least one vegetable
                you don't normally buy. Doesn't matter if you don't know what to
                do with it, you can Google once you've got it home.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Keep your veggies where you can see them</h2>

            <p>
                Is your veg hiding in the drawer at the bottom of the fridge or
                at the back of a cupboard?
            </p>

            <p>
                Go to the kitchen now and move all the veg to the front of your
                shelves, as close as you can to eye level. Any veg that doesn't
                need to be cold or dark can be kept out in full view.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Sneak extra veg into your favorite meals</h2>

            <p>
                Every time you make a sandwich, add a slice of cucumber, tomato
                or a letuce leaf. Every time you make bolognese, grate in some
                carrot or courgette.
            </p>

            <p>
                For each of your go-to meals are, think of an extra vegetable
                you can add.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Start at breakfast</h2>

            <p>Veg should be part of every meal, not just dinner.</p>

            <p>
                Start each day the way you mean to go on by adding some veg to
                your breakfast. I'm a fan of chopped spring onions in my
                scrambled eggs!
            </p>

            <p>
                It's so satisfying to have something to log in the Veghacker app
                before the day has even got going!
            </p>

            <h2>Keep on veghacking</h2>

            <p>
                If you try buying different veg, keep it visible and find ways
                to add veg to meals, even breakfast, you are going to see some
                wonderful results in your veg log and you'll be making long-term
                improvements to your health.
