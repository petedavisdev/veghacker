<h1>How to eat more vegetables</h1>
<p>Here are 5 hacks that are guaranteed to get more veggies in your diet. The fifth one is a game-changer!</p>
<h2>1. Keep a veg log</h2>
<p>What we measure, we improve - James Clear</p>
<p>The place to start when you want to create a healthy habit is to measure the right thing. With veg, it's the variety that's important. Keep a log of the different types of veg you eat every day. The Veghacker app is the easiest and most rewarding way to do this.</p>
<h2>2. Buy more vegetables</h2>
<p>Might seem obvious, but to eat more veg, you have to buy more veg. Next time you are buying groceries, get at least one vegetable you don't normally buy. Don't worry if you've never had it before, you will figure what to do with it when you get it home.</p>
<h2>3. Keep your veggies where you can see them</h2>
<p>Is your veg hiding in the drawer at the bottom of the fridge or at the back of a cupboard? Go to the kitchen now and move all the veg to the front of your shelves, as close as you can to eye level. Any veg that doesn't need to be cold or dark can be kept out in full view.</p>
<h2>4. Sneak extra veg into your favorite meals</h2>
<p>Every time you make a sandwich, add a slice of cucumber, tomato or a letuce leaf. Every time you make bolognese, grate in some carrot or courgette. For each of your go-to meals are, think of an extra vegetable you can add.</p>
<h2>5. Start at breakfast</h2>
