### About

Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pete Davis. Veghacker is my little side project that I'm making for fun to motivate myself to eat a variety of vegetables consistently and I hope some other people will find it useful too.

Here's some more motivation:

- [BBC: Why are Brits obsessed with the same four vegetables?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/veg_variety)
- [Telegraph: Good nutrition is crucial for the coronavirus vaccine to work effectively](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/good-nutrition-can-make-vaccines-effective/)
